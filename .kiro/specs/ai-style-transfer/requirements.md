# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Photobooth currently performs basic face placement by detecting faces and placing them in mask areas of themed templates. However, it lacks true style adaptation - the ability to transform the user's facial features, skin tone, hair, and overall appearance to authentically match the chosen theme style (barbarian, Greek, mystic, anime). This feature will implement advanced AI-powered style transfer and face adaptation to create realistic themed transformations rather than simple face overlays.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Advanced Face Style Transfer

**User Story:** As a user, I want my face to be transformed to match the theme style (not just placed on it), so that I look like I authentically belong in that themed world.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a barbarian theme is selected THEN the system SHALL transform facial features to appear more rugged with weathered skin texture
2. WHEN a Greek theme is selected THEN the system SHALL adapt features to classical proportions with marble-like skin smoothness
3. WHEN a mystic theme is selected THEN the system SHALL add ethereal qualities with enhanced eyes and mystical skin tones
4. WHEN an anime theme is selected THEN the system SHALL stylize features with larger eyes, smoother skin, and cartoon-like qualities
5. WHEN style transfer is applied THEN the system SHALL preserve the user's core facial identity while adapting to theme aesthetics
6. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL maintain facial expressions and pose from the original photo
7. WHEN multiple themes are tested THEN the system SHALL produce distinctly different stylistic results for each theme

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Skin Tone and Texture Adaptation

**User Story:** As a user, I want my skin to be adapted to match the theme's aesthetic (weathered, smooth, mystical, etc.), so that the transformation looks natural and cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN barbarian style is applied THEN the system SHALL add realistic weathering, scars, and rugged skin texture
2. WHEN Greek style is applied THEN the system SHALL create smooth, marble-like skin with classical lighting
3. WHEN mystic style is applied THEN the system SHALL add ethereal glow, color shifts, and magical skin effects
4. WHEN anime style is applied THEN the system SHALL create smooth, porcelain-like skin with stylized shading
5. WHEN skin adaptation occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve natural skin undertones while enhancing theme-appropriate qualities
6. WHEN lighting conditions vary THEN the system SHALL adapt skin rendering to match the theme's lighting style
7. WHEN processing different ethnicities THEN the system SHALL respect and enhance natural features while applying theme styling

### Requirement 3: Hair and Facial Hair Style Transfer

**User Story:** As a user, I want my hair and facial hair to be transformed to match the theme style, so that my overall appearance is cohesive with the chosen aesthetic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN barbarian theme is selected THEN the system SHALL add or enhance rugged, wild hair and beard styles
2. WHEN Greek theme is selected THEN the system SHALL style hair in classical arrangements (curls, braids, or clean styles)
3. WHEN mystic theme is selected THEN the system SHALL add flowing, ethereal hair with magical color highlights
4. WHEN anime theme is selected THEN the system SHALL stylize hair with vibrant colors and exaggerated volume
5. WHEN hair transformation occurs THEN the system SHALL respect the user's original hair length and basic style
6. WHEN facial hair is present THEN the system SHALL enhance or modify it to match the theme aesthetic
7. WHEN hair color changes THEN the system SHALL ensure natural-looking color transitions and highlights

### Requirement 4: Eye Enhancement and Style Adaptation

**User Story:** As a user, I want my eyes to be enhanced to match the theme's characteristic eye styles, so that they convey the appropriate mood and aesthetic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN barbarian theme is applied THEN the system SHALL enhance eyes with intensity, weathered look, and battle-hardened expression
2. WHEN Greek theme is applied THEN the system SHALL create classical eye proportions with noble, serene expressions
3. WHEN mystic theme is applied THEN the system SHALL add magical glow, color shifts, or ethereal qualities to eyes
4. WHEN anime theme is applied THEN the system SHALL enlarge eyes and add stylized highlights and reflections
5. WHEN eye enhancement occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve the user's natural eye color unless theme requires specific changes
6. WHEN eye makeup is applied THEN the system SHALL add theme-appropriate makeup styles (war paint, classical, mystical, anime)
7. WHEN expressions are modified THEN the system SHALL maintain the user's original emotional expression while enhancing theme qualities

### Requirement 5: Facial Feature Proportion Adjustment

**User Story:** As a user, I want subtle adjustments to my facial proportions that enhance the theme aesthetic, so that I look like I naturally belong in that style world.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN barbarian theme is applied THEN the system SHALL subtly enhance jaw strength and add rugged facial structure
2. WHEN Greek theme is applied THEN the system SHALL adjust proportions toward classical golden ratio ideals
3. WHEN mystic theme is applied THEN the system SHALL create more ethereal, otherworldly facial proportions
4. WHEN anime theme is applied THEN the system SHALL adjust features toward stylized cartoon proportions (larger eyes, smaller nose)
5. WHEN proportions are adjusted THEN the system SHALL maintain the user's recognizable facial identity
6. WHEN adjustments are made THEN the system SHALL ensure all changes look natural and not distorted
7. WHEN different face shapes are processed THEN the system SHALL adapt adjustments appropriately for each individual

### Requirement 6: Advanced Lighting and Atmosphere Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the lighting on my face to match the theme's atmospheric conditions, so that I appear naturally integrated into the themed environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN barbarian theme is used THEN the system SHALL apply dramatic, harsh lighting with strong shadows
2. WHEN Greek theme is used THEN the system SHALL create soft, classical lighting reminiscent of marble sculptures
3. WHEN mystic theme is used THEN the system SHALL add magical ambient lighting with color casts and glows
4. WHEN anime theme is used THEN the system SHALL apply stylized, high-contrast lighting with cell-shading effects
5. WHEN lighting is applied THEN the system SHALL ensure shadows and highlights match the background environment
6. WHEN atmospheric effects are added THEN the system SHALL include theme-appropriate particles, mist, or magical effects
7. WHEN color grading is applied THEN the system SHALL ensure the face color palette harmonizes with the background

### Requirement 7: Quality Control and Realism Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the style transfer to look realistic and high-quality, so that the result appears professionally created rather than obviously AI-generated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN style transfer completes THEN the system SHALL validate that facial features remain proportional and natural-looking
2. WHEN transformations are applied THEN the system SHALL ensure no uncanny valley effects or distortions occur
3. WHEN multiple processing attempts occur THEN the system SHALL produce consistent results for the same input
4. WHEN edge cases are encountered THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle unusual facial features or angles
5. WHEN quality is insufficient THEN the system SHALL provide fallback to simpler processing or request photo retake
6. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific feedback about what aspects need improvement
7. WHEN final output is generated THEN the system SHALL meet professional quality standards suitable for sharing

### Requirement 8: Performance and Processing Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the advanced style transfer to complete in reasonable time, so that I don't have to wait excessively for high-quality results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN advanced processing is initiated THEN the system SHALL complete style transfer within 30 seconds (target: 20 seconds)
2. WHEN GPU resources are available THEN the system SHALL utilize them for accelerated neural network processing
3. WHEN processing load is high THEN the system SHALL queue requests and provide accurate wait time estimates
4. WHEN style transfer occurs THEN the system SHALL show detailed progress indicators for each processing stage
5. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent retry with different parameters
6. WHEN resources are limited THEN the system SHALL offer reduced quality options for faster processing
7. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL cache intermediate results to speed up similar future requests
