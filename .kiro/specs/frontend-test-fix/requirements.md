# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The frontend testing suite is currently failing due to configuration issues in the test setup file and vitest configuration. The primary issue is duplicate import statements in the test setup file that prevent the tests from running, along with module resolution problems for `webidl-conversions` and `whatwg-url` packages. This feature will fix these configuration issues to restore a working test environment for the frontend package.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend test suite to run without compilation errors, so that I can validate my code changes and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend test command is executed THEN the system SHALL compile the test setup file without duplicate import errors
2. WHEN vitest runs THEN the system SHALL successfully load all test modules without webidl-conversions errors
3. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL complete the test run without unhandled errors
4. WHEN the CI pipeline runs THEN the frontend tests SHALL pass and not block the build process

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper module mocking for browser APIs and problematic dependencies, so that tests can run in a Node.js environment without browser-specific errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests require browser APIs THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate mocks for URL, URLSearchParams, fetch, and navigator
2. WHEN webidl-conversions or whatwg-url modules are imported THEN the system SHALL provide working mock implementations
3. WHEN ResizeObserver or IntersectionObserver are used THEN the system SHALL provide functional mock implementations
4. WHEN matchMedia is called THEN the system SHALL return a properly mocked media query list

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean test output without unnecessary error messages, so that I can focus on actual test failures and debugging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN expected test errors occur THEN the system SHALL suppress console output for known harmless errors
2. WHEN webidl-conversions warnings appear THEN the system SHALL filter them from console output
3. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL only display relevant test results and actual failures
4. WHEN debugging tests THEN the system SHALL maintain clear error reporting for genuine issues
