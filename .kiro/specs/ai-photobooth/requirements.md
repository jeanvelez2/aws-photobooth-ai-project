# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Photobooth is a web-based application that allows users to take photos using their device camera and have their faces intelligently integrated into themed backgrounds (barbarian, greek, mystic, anime) using AI-powered face processing. The system consists of a React frontend, Node.js backend processing service running on AWS ECS Fargate with GPU support, and AWS cloud infrastructure for storage and delivery.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Camera Capture and Photo Taking

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access my device camera and take high-quality photos, so that I can capture my face for theme integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the application THEN the system SHALL request camera permissions using WebRTC
2. WHEN camera permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL display a live camera preview with user controls
3. WHEN the user captures a photo THEN the system SHALL save the image in high resolution (minimum 1920x1080)
4. WHEN the user is on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL support both front and rear camera selection
5. WHEN the user wants to retake a photo THEN the system SHALL provide a retake functionality that clears the current capture
6. WHEN camera permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages explaining the requirement
7. WHEN image processing begins THEN the system SHALL show loading states with progress indicators

### Requirement 2: Theme Selection and Preview

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select from different themed backgrounds and see how they will look with my photo, so that I can choose the best theme for my image.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses theme selection THEN the system SHALL display a gallery with thumbnails and descriptions for all available themes
2. WHEN the application launches THEN the system SHALL support four initial themes: Barbarian, Greek, Mystic, and Anime
3. WHEN the user selects a theme THEN the system SHALL allow theme selection before or after photo capture
4. WHEN a theme is selected and photo is captured THEN the system SHALL show a theme preview overlay on the captured photo
5. WHEN browsing themes THEN the system SHALL support theme variants with different poses and backgrounds per theme

### Requirement 3: AI-Powered Face Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want my face to be automatically detected and seamlessly integrated into the chosen theme, so that I get a professional-looking themed portrait.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL detect faces using AWS Rekognition with >95% accuracy
2. WHEN a face is detected THEN the system SHALL extract facial landmarks using Rekognition (27+ key points including eyes, nose, mouth)
3. WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL validate face quality using Rekognition quality metrics for brightness and sharpness
4. WHEN multiple faces are detected THEN the system SHALL handle single face scenarios for MVP implementation
5. WHEN face landmarks are extracted THEN the system SHALL align and scale the face to match the theme template
6. WHEN integrating the face THEN the system SHALL perform color correction for lighting consistency between face and background
7. WHEN compositing the image THEN the system SHALL blend face edges seamlessly with the background using advanced blending techniques
8. WHEN no face is detected OR face is too small OR extreme angles OR low quality THEN the system SHALL handle these edge cases gracefully with appropriate error messages
9. WHEN processing starts THEN the system SHALL complete image processing within 15 seconds (target: 8 seconds)

### Requirement 4: Image Output and Download

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview and download my processed themed image in high quality, so that I can save and share my photobooth creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL generate high-resolution output (minimum 2400x3200px)
2. WHEN generating output THEN the system SHALL support both JPEG and PNG formats
3. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide an image preview before download
4. WHEN the user downloads THEN the system SHALL enable download with custom filename options
5. WHEN sharing is requested THEN the system SHALL optionally generate a shareable link with 24-hour expiration

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when something goes wrong and reliable retry options, so that I can successfully create my themed photo even if issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no face is detected in the uploaded image THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with helpful guidance for retaking the photo
2. WHEN processing fails due to technical issues THEN the system SHALL implement a retry mechanism with up to 3 attempts
3. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages that explain the issue and next steps
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging and monitoring purposes

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and process my images efficiently, so that I have a smooth and responsive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first visits the application THEN the system SHALL complete initial page load in less than 3 seconds
2. WHEN image processing begins THEN the system SHALL complete processing in less than 15 seconds (target: 8 seconds)
3. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN the system SHALL support 100 concurrent users without performance degradation
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL respond in less than 200ms (excluding processing operations)
5. WHEN traffic increases THEN the system SHALL auto-scale ECS tasks based on CPU and memory utilization
6. WHEN daily usage occurs THEN the system SHALL handle up to 10,000 images per day
7. WHEN traffic spikes occur THEN the system SHALL support burst traffic up to 5x normal load

### Requirement 7: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a user, I want my photos and personal data to be handled securely and privately, so that I can trust the application with my images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading images THEN the system SHALL use pre-signed URLs for S3 uploads with 15-minute expiration
2. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate image file types and enforce maximum size limits (10MB)
3. WHEN users make requests THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting (10 requests per minute per IP)
4. WHEN any communication occurs THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS only for all endpoints
5. WHEN serving content THEN the system SHALL implement Content Security Policy headers
