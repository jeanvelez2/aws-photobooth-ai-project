## 📋 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### Priority 1 (Deploy Infrastructure) - READY ✅
1. **CDK infrastructure is ready** - `packages/infrastructure/` contains complete stack
2. **GitHub Actions will handle deployment** - Push to main branch triggers deployment
3. **All CDK outputs configured** - Bucket names, table names, URLs automatically handled

### Priority 2 (Content & Deployment) - AUTOMATED ✅
4. **Theme assets handled by GitHub Actions** - Placeholder SVGs created automatically
5. **DynamoDB seeding automated** - GitHub Actions calls theme seeding endpoints
6. **Docker images built automatically** - ECR push handled by workflow

### Priority 3 (Manual Tasks Required)
7. **Set up GitHub repository secrets**:
   - `AWS_ROLE_ARN` (GitHub OIDC role)
   - `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` (your AWS account)
8. **Push code to main branch** to trigger deployment
9. **Create real theme images** (currently using placeholder SVGs)

### Priority 4 (Post-Deployment)
10. **Test complete workflow** after deployment
11. **Replace placeholder theme images** with actual artwork
12. **Monitor performance** and costs
